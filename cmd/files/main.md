# IMPORTANT!

![Alt text](/images/example.jpeg)

- Every directory within wikinow has to include a file called `main.md` which will serve as the entrypoint to that directory.
- Files must include the metadata `title` as you can see above.
- Every feature from CommonMark is supported. [You can check them here](https://commonmark.org/help/)

## SIDEBAR

You can see by using `wikinow start` that you have a sidebar. This is where all your files are going to be nested in directories.

## SEARCH

You also have access to a basic search, which you can use to look for text within the files or the files itself.

## HAVE FUN

I guess that is everything you have to know to start exploring Wikinow. Have fun!
